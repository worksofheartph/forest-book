          <!--<h2>Case studies on the age of the Anthropocene</h2>-->
          <p>
            The Anthropocene, or the age of man, as proposed current epoch characterizes the
            dominant influence of humans on climate and the environment. The anthropogenic
            nature of the global climate crisis and cross-cutting socio-environmental challenges have
            highlighted the historical imprints of humanity on the natural world. The Philippines is
            no stranger to the unfortunate reality of an increasingly warmer planet, rising sea levels,
            deforestation, and forest and landscape degradation.</p>

            <p><b>Forests in the Anthropocene: Perspectives from the Philippines</b> shares a compendium
            of Filipino interdisciplinary scholarship on the interplay of forest and people in the age
            of mankind. This book, composed of six chapters, aims to provide local accounts of
            human and forest dynamics, and probe into the historical trajectories and conservation
            experiences within the mosaics of forest landscapes across the archipelago.</p>

            <p>The diverse configurations of forests are the living heritage and beating landscape of our
            collective history and aspirations as peoples. It is hoped that this book drives different
            sectors toward a deeper appreciation, social commitment, and collective action for the
            protection and conservation of the Philippine forests.</p><br><br>
