    <h2>The Age of Anthropocene</h2>
    <p>
    The Anthropocene, or the age of man, as proposed current geologic age characterizes the dominant influence of humans on climate and the environment. The Philippines is no stranger to the unfortunate reality of an increasingly warmer planet, rising sea levels, deforestation, and forest and landscape degradation.
    </p>
    <p>Forests in the Anthropocene: Perspectives from the Philippines shares a compendium of Filipino multidisciplinary scholarship on the archipelagic interplay of forest and people in the Anthropocene. This book aims to provide local accounts of human and forest dynamics—what has been and could be done to promote a just and inclusive governance. It is hoped that this book drives different sectors toward a deeper appreciation, social commitment, and collective action for the protection and conservation of the Philippines forests.</p>

It applies this approach to two projects which engage with six community-based forestry initiatives in the Kalatungan Mountain Range.

Their ability to steward their ancestral lands may be enhanced by applying social network theories and tools.</p></div>

    <h3>Protecting the environment</h3>
    <h1>An Exploration of the Roles, Motivations, and Live Experiences of Forest Guards in the Philippines</h1>
    <p>Gideon Lasco, PhD</p>
  </section>


  <section id="" class="preview">
  <hr>
  <div class="col-2"><h4>Despite the existence of forest guards or “bantay gubat” as field-level implementers of environmental policies all over the country, and despite the violence they face, little scholarship has been done to document their motivations, roles, and lived experiences.</h4></div>
  <div class="col-2">
      <p>This chapter seeks to fill this void by presenting findings from a multi-sited qualitative study, in which 12 focus group discussions were conducted among forest guards in Luzon and Northern Mindanao.

Common themes that emerged include the sense of financial, physical, and legal vulnerability, lack of recognition, the role of politics in their work, and a range of motivations including a strong sense of identity and a conception of the mountains as “home.”</p></div>

  <section id="" class="preview">
  <hr>
  <div class="col-2"><h4>In the Anthropocene, it is worth exploring forest livelihood projects that promote multiple forest products and see whether they are more beneficial for forest-dependent peoples and their forest in the long-term than projects that only focus on one forest product.</h4></div>
  <div class="col-2">
      <p>Focusing on honey from giant honey bees (Apis dorsata) and hinabol from abacá (Musa textilis) plants, this research assessed how mobile (giant honey bees) and immobile (abacá plants) agents shape both the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and the ecological integrity of a community forest landscape.</p>

      <p>This chapter shows that diversified livelihoods contribute to the ethnocompetitiveness of the Higaonon community and could decrease natural resource exploitation pressure on a single forest product while maintaining forest cover. </p></div>

  <section id="" class="preview">
  <hr>
  <div class="col-2"><h4>The forest conservation and energy access nexus, with climate change looming large in the horizon, is considered as one of the paramount concerns in the Anthropocene. The imperatives to adapt to and mitigate the changes spawned by the Anthropocene put pressure on legal systems to respond and adjust.</h4></div>

      <p>The forest conservation and energy access nexus remains unexplored in the context of the the Philippines’ institutional, legal, and policy frameworks, which is reflected in the lack of research and literature looking into such linkages. </p>

      <p>This chapter introduces the nexus approach for the first time as an analytical and exploratory tool; it propounds that such an approach has the potential to uncover the gaps in the forest and energy policy environment and enhance integration and coherence to attain common or shared objectives. </p></div>
